    <h1>UX designer, strategist, researcher, <br>
        visual designer, front-end <br>
        developer, and accessibility <br>
        advocate.</h1>
    <h3>about</h3>
    <p>Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br>
        Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br>
        Designers are toolmakers. <br>
        Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br>
        Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. <br>
        Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
    <h3>hard skills</h3>
    <p>stakeholder workshops design thinking exercises <br>
        accessibility audits heuristic evaluations <br>
        analytics audits surveys and focus groups <br>
        moderated user testing unmoderated user testing <br>
        card-sorting navigation tree testing</p>
    <h3>writing and more</h3>

    <p>Generates Voronoi cell networks as vector shape layers within Figma <br>
        from a seed frame populated with ellipses marking initial node points.</p>
    <h5>@sposhe/voronoi</h5>
    <p>Creates an organically random distribution of one or more Figma elements <br>
